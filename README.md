Credit Card Fraud Detection Comparative Study 

This repository contains the implementation and experiments for the paper: 
"Comparative Study of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods for Credit Card Fraud Detection on Imbalanced Data" 

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/keremmust/

Overview
This study investigates the performance of multiple machine learning and deep learning models for credit card fraud detection on a highly imbalanced dataset. We focus on widely used classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron) and evaluate them under both baseline settings and SMOTE-based oversampling to address class imbalance. Performance is assessed using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

All analyses were conducted using Python in Google Colab, and the results reported in the paper can be fully reproduced using the provided code. 

Dataset
The dataset used in this study was obtained from Kaggle.
